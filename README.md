Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge project! This project involves deploying a static website to Azure, showcasing my resume. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform, following best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This project is a part of the Cloud Resume Challenge, a popular initiative to demonstrate cloud skills.
